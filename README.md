5. After some secounds you should see **Module installed"*. Click the *Configure*-button.

6. Inside the module configuration page you will be asked to insert API-key and Secret API-key. <br>Go to your LipScore member page > *Settings > General > API settings*, where you must copy the API key to paste here. Be careful not to include spaces in the code.

7. Select the order-state you want automatic review invitations to be sent by, as well as the wanted identifier for your products. In most cases order-state *Delivered* and  *Product-reference* is recommended, and only needs to be changed if you know what you are doing.

8. Under *Placements* you can select what widgets that should be used. Try them all and observe the changes in your PrestaShop Front-office. Again: if you do not use the Classic theme, it might not work.
