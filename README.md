# How to install the LipScore module v. 1.0.4 for PrestaShop

**Requirements:**
- PrestaShop 1.7.7.2
- PrestaShop default theme *Classic*
- The module might work with other versions, but there is no guarantee for this.


## Steps
1. Download the module zip-file
2. Login to your PrestaShop back-office and navigate to *Modules* > *Module Manager*
3. In the upper right corner you will find *Upload a module* - Click it.
4. Proceed by dragging the module zip-file onto the window that opened.
5. After some secounds you should see **Module installed"*. Click the *Configure*-button.

6. Inside the module configuration page you will be asked to insert API-key and Secret API-key. <br>Go to your LipScore member page > *Settings > General > API settings*, where you must copy the API key to paste here. Be careful not to include spaces in the code.

7. Select the order-state you want automatic review invitations to be sent by, as well as the wanted identifier for your products. In most cases order-state *Delivered* and  *Product-reference* is recommended, and only needs to be changed if you know what you are doing.

8. Under *Placements* you can select what widgets that should be used. Try them all and observe the changes in your PrestaShop Front-office. Again: if you do not use the Classic theme, it might not work.

9. After clicking **Save** you should see the following text to get a confirmation that everything is set up correctly:  *⭐️ LipScore API is now in communication with your webshop!*
